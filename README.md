-	New regulations limited size and increased complexity.
-	Jamie Dimon (J.P. Morgan Chase Chief Executive Officer) during one of the interviews at the time said, "Counter to what most people think, many of the extreme actions we took were not done to make a profit; they were done to support our country and the financial system"
-	Retail banking assets of Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns; these takeovers lead to billions of dollars in litigation costs tied to mortgages.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

JP Morgan Chase:  30,000 middle-market customers, 
                                1,700 corporate banking customers and 
                                1,100 commercial real estate banking customers.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

(Value creation through sustainability)
The following competitive advantages help JPMorgan survive the downturn:
•	Half of JPMorgan’s net revenue comes from noninterest revenue sources
•	Strong balance sheet 
•	Superior profitability compared to main competitors
Overall, JPMorgan deals with industry competition in three main ways:
•	Offering customer convenience and low-cost through cutting-edge services
•	By distinguishing itself in the marketplace primarily based on its history and experience, creating a niche market for itself.
•	Removing some potential competition through acquiring smaller banks.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

-	The Future of Technology 
To meet consumer demands and market trends different technologies are being implemented quite rapidly in the banking sector.
Mobile and electronic payments, big data, cloud computing and cyber security are technologies being used to provide better service for customers.
“We are an unexpected disruptor in banking and in the technology industry," said Feinsmith. "Because technology changes so quickly we are not only developing technology for today, but we are also anticipating the technology needs of our consumers 5-10 years down the road."
-	Use of ML
ML is used to personalize the digital experience of research platform that JP Morgan has. The platform produces over 10,000 pieces of research a year
Each client logs into a customized portal that provides relevant and unique research, personalized to their needs, this is done through Machine Learning.
-	Use of AI
Through artificial intelligence, JP Morgan has a system that engages with clients, customers, and employees effectively.
 
JP Morgan was one of the first banks to have an AI-powered virtual assistant that makes it more effective for corporate clients to move money around the world.
Consistent customer service experience that provides customers the power to ask any type of question they want, be it balances, or answers to any questions they have.

Machine learning allows the AI-powered assistant to adapt to clients' behaviour over time and make insightful recommendations for them. For example: if a customer authorizes multiple wires/payments in each period of time, the virtual assistant could say: "Looks like you have sent 100 U.S. dollar wires to Singapore. Do you know you can send a foreign exchange ACH payment instead? Click here to sign up."

AI-powered virtual assistants/Robo Advisors will be integrated into all areas of the bank to deliver value to the customers, which is a first step of digitalization in customer services offered by Banks. 
Routine questions such as "Did my trade go through?" and "How can I reset my password?"; can be answered readily to save employees and customer’s time.

-	Blockchain Revolution
Can Blockchain be implemented beyond payments methods ?
"We're actively exploring applications of blockchain technology across all of our lines of business," says Feinsmith. "We believe blockchain technology can be a game changer in terms of process optimization, improved client experience, and the creation of new revenue streams."
JP Morgan and Feinsmith has been working on Blockchain projects that explore concepts beyond Cryptocurrency.
One of these projects is Quorum, an ethereum-based, enterprise-focused platform that is built with open-source code. This platform combines enterprise-strength software with a high-level compliance for processing of private transactions of customers.
Its rapid adoption by developers has solidified the significance of players like JPMorgan in the blockchain ecosystem and gives it a competitive edge.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

I would suggest advancing their research on Robo advisors and create something that is even more advanced and is more intrinsic; also aligns with human needs and generates value to the customer. 

Along with machine learning, I would say to work more with IOT- Internet of things and deep learning. focusing on smart contracts from now as I believe that is the future. 

Crypto’s like cardano Solana polka dot are used for making banking transactions which reduces costs substantially.
 
Solana and etherium is used for issue of NFT non fungible tokens.
Bitcoin since it is limited in number can serve purpose of digital gold thus reducing environment costs of mining physical gold 
For example: What Cardano is doing in Ethiopia as part of digital transformation in the country.

Also crypto can be used for drawing smart contracts reducing costs and time taken in drawing physical contracts.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Offering these services will give JP Morgan chase more competitive advantage over its competitors. More advancements will lead to more stability in the future and attract more clients to associate with the bank. As JP Morgan Case will be leading the digital revolution curve and offer services that other banks will not but will generate value to customers through their technology and services which is something any its competitors will not be able to do.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

1. Machine Learning
More advanced Machine learning algorithms can be used to give better experience to customers.

2.  AI
Recommendation feature (recommendations catering to clients’ needs and preferences) can be improved, to provide best service to customers.

3.Blockchain

Solana and etherium is used for issue of NFT non fungible tokens.
Bitcoin since it is limited in number can serve purpose of digital gold thus reducing environment costs of mining physical gold 

4.Deep Technologies
Deep technologies and computer vision can be used to give a human effect to technologies used and make it more user friendly.

5. Cryptocurrencies

Crypto’s like cardano, Solana, polka dot is used for making banking transactions which reduces costs substantially.

Also, crypto can be used for drawing smart contracts reducing costs and time taken in drawing physical contracts.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
